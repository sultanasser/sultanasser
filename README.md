### [Brief Introduction]
I am an IT professional with profound interest in Cybersecurity where I graduted with a Masters degree, and a dedication to solving complex problems.
My curiosity and passion in learning more in this field led me to taking security courses offered by YUPRO and Coursera. I also have some skills in Data Analysis.
I learned those skills from courses I took with Cisco Networking Academy.


# Objective
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
